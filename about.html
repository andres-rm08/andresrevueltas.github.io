        Hi, my name is Andres Revueltas, and I recently graduated Cornell University with a Bachelors in Physics. I have a strong interest in 
        data analysis, research, and problem-solving. My experience ranges from analyzing 
        exoplanet data with Python and SQL, to building automated workflows for city operations, 
        to mentoring and leadership in student organizations. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond academics, I’m passionate about applying technical skills to practical challenges, 
        especially in areas like research, compliance, and operations where data-driven insights 
        improve real outcomes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I created this site to share my background and projects as I continue developing 
        skills in technology and research.
